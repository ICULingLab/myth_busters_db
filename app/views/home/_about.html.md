# About this site

The Myth Busters DB site is a database of texts that translate a set of mythbusters regarding COVID-19. 
The project began in May 2020 to share correct information with speakers of minority languages. 
As of February 1, 2021, versions in 116 languages/scripts are available. 

This database is a text only version created for NLP researchers who are interested in accessing 
a small set of data across muliple languages.
